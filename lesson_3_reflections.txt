When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you have multiple users contributing to the project

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks - only exist on GitHub
clones - make copies of same thing
branches - branch form the master branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

In case you do not have internet access for a while

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Phone each other. Easier to stay update with each other, harder everything else

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

So other people could check for mistakes before you commit it to master
