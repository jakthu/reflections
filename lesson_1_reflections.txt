How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Instead of looking manually for the differences it showed all 
the differences in bash so I could quickly find the spelling error.

Reflect: Using history for efficiency
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient 
programmer in the long term?

Could revert mistakes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions 
automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Your saves are more logical so they are easier to understand

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git has several files that are related to each other, like an HTML and CSS file, while Docs just has one
file

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log shows all commits (scrool down with arrow key to see more commits) with their message, 
git diff shows what changed between 2 commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

you can make changes knowing that you can undo them
